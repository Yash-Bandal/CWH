## Callbacks
Imagine you’re at a café, and you order a coffee. The barista tells you, “I’ll make your coffee, and once it’s ready, I’ll call you.”
Now, you wait, but you can do other things while waiting, like checking your phone. When the coffee is ready, the barista calls you (like a callback -Notifiaction) 
to let you know it’s time to pick it up.

In programming, a callback is like that phone call. It’s a function that you give to another function to be called later, once a certain task is completed.

## Promises:
Now, let’s talk about promises. A promise is like the café giving you a ticket when you order your coffee. The ticket represents that your coffee will be ready at some point in the future. The café doesn’t call you immediately, but they promise that your coffee will be ready, and they will let you know when it's done.

In programming, a promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

There are three states for a promise:

- Pending – The promise is still waiting to be fulfilled. <br>
- Resolved (or fulfilled) – The operation was successful. <br>
- Rejected – Something went wrong.
