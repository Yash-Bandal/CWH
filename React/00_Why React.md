# Why React?
HTML when loaded in web..browser takes code and builds a tree like structure DOM

# React.js - Lesson 1: Introduction

## What is React?
React is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**, especially for **single-page applications** (SPAs). It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

## Key Features
- **Component-Based:** UI is built using reusable components.
- **Declarative:** Describe what the UI should look like, and React takes care of updating it.
- **Virtual DOM:** Efficiently updates the web page by only changing whatâ€™s necessary.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data flows in one direction, making it easier to debug.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML):** HTML-like syntax used in JavaScript to describe UI.

---

## Why Use React?
- Makes code more **modular** and **maintainable**.
- Widely used in **industry** (Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc.).
- Huge **community** and rich ecosystem of libraries.
- Works well with other libraries/frameworks (like Redux, React Router).

---

## Who Created React?
- Developed by **Facebook** (now Meta).
- Open-sourced in **2013**.
