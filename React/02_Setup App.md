# Lesson 2: Setting Up a React Project

There are **2 popular ways** to set up a new React project:

---

### âœ… Method 1: Using Vite (Recommended - Fast & Modern)

#### ðŸ“¦ Step-by-Step:
1. **Install Node.js** from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version is best)
2. Open terminal and run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
3. Give your project a name (e.g., `my-react-app`)
4. Select **React** and then **JavaScript** (or TypeScript if you're using TS)
5. Go into your project folder:
```bash
cd my-react-app
```
6. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
7. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
8. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`

âœ… You now have a working React project using Vite!

### âœ… Method 2: Using Create React App (CRA - Older, but still used)

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

ðŸŸ¡ CRA is a bit slower and heavier than Vite, but still fine for learning.
